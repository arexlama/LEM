you have 69 different radios. each has it's own ID, power enabled/disabled or frequency it's operating on. you have to
utilize the Radio class' api to find your way to the given radio id without seeing the id itself. the radio then will
receive another encrypted message, which you'll have to decrypt in the next task

create an object type Radio with properties wanted for completing the task

if necessary, add this api:

class Radio:
    def __str__(self):
        # returns radio's id in string

    def mod_freq(self, amount: float) -> None:
        # changes the radio's frequency according to amount given

    def turn_power(self) -> None:
        # bangs (turns on or off) the radio's power

def connect(new_radio: Radio) -> None:
    # connects to the radio given and saves it's ID to current_radio as str

radio: Radio
